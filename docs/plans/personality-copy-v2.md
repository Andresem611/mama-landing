# MAMA Personality Copy v2

**Direction:** Ragebaiting through uncomfortable relatability, not quirky sass.

The brand IS the ragebaiting: "You're an adult who can't make a phone call."
MAMA's energy: passive-aggressive love, guilt while helping, treating you like you're still 12.

2. **No exclamation marks** - Moms don't get excited about your failures
3. **Mild disappointment > sass** - Feels more real
4. **Assume incompetence** - She's not surprised, just helping
5. **Passive voice** - "This is gonna take a while" not "We're gonna do this!"
6. **Questions are accusations** - "When was your last cleaning" not "Time for a cleaning!"
